        <h1>Sailing to Philadelphia</h1>
        <h2>Mark Knopfler</h2>
            <p>I am Jeremiah Dixon<br>I am a Geordie boy<br>A glass of wine with you, sir<br>And the ladies I'll enjoy<br>All Durham and Northumberland<br>Is measured up by my own hand<br>It was my fate from birth<br>To make my mark upon the earth<br></p>
            <p>He calls me Charlie Mason<br>A stargazer am I<br>It seems that I was born<br>To chart the evening sky<br>They'd cut me out for baking bread<br>But I had other dreams instead<br>This baker's boy from the west country<br>Would join the Royal
                Society<br></p>
            <p>We are sailing to Philadelphia<br>A world away from the coaly Tyne<br>Sailing to Philadelphia<br>To draw the line<br>A Mason-Dixon Line<br></p>
            <p>Now you're a good surveyor, Dixon<br>But I swear you'll make me mad<br>The West will kill us both<br>You gullible Geordie lad<br>You talk of liberty<br>How can America be free<br>A Geordie and a baker's boy<br>In the forests of the Iroquois<br></p>
            <p>Now hold your head up, Mason<br>See America lies there<br>The morning tide has raised<br>The capes of Delaware<br>Come up and feel the sun<br>A new morning has begun<br>Another day will make it clear<br>Why your stars should guide us here<br></p>
            <p>We are sailing to Philadelphia<br>A world away from the coaly Tyne<br>Sailing to Philadelphia<br>To draw the line<br>A Mason-Dixon Line<br></p>
